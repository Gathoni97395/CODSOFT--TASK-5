# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on transaction data. The dataset used contains various features of credit card transactions, and the model aims to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent.
### Overview

Credit card fraud is a growing concern, and detecting fraudulent transactions efficiently is crucial for maintaining the security and trust of financial institutions and customers. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to detect patterns in transaction data that indicate potential fraud.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. This dataset consists of credit card transactions made by cardholders, and the features include:

- `Time`: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- `V1, V2, ..., V28`: 28 anonymized features created through PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation.
- `Amount`: The amount of the transaction.
- `Class`: The target variable (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

### Software
The project was done with python, jupyter notebooks.

### data cleaning and validation
Data cleaning was conductecd by handling mising values.
Dta validation was conducted by checking for accuracy of the dataset.

### Data modelling and processing
 Data Preprocessing was done by handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features.
The data was then split into training and test sets.
Model Selection:
    Several machine learning models were tested, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest
    The models were trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
### Model Evaluation:
   - The model was evaluated using a confusion matrix to calculate the precision, recall, and F1-score, as fraudulent transactions are rare and require special attention to false positives and false negatives.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The percentage of predicted fraudulent transactions that are actually fraudulent.
- **Recall**: The percentage of actual fraudulent transactions that were correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Based on the chosen model and hyperparameters, the results are summarized as follows:

- Accuracy: 
- Precision: 
- Recall: 
- F1-Score:
